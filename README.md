<strong>Deep Learning Regression with Admissions Data</strong><br>
This project is focused on creating a deep learning regression model that predicts the likelihood that a student applying to graduate school will be accepted based on various application factors (such as test scores).
Data is obtained from Kaggle (also included in this repo): https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv
